          Greetings! I am Vineeth Ketham, a dedicated software developer currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at Saint Louis University. With a proven track record in envisioning, coding, and managing cutting-edge software systems, I bring a wealth of experience to the table. During my internships at DizitalZap and ThePaperBrains in Hyderabad, India, I honed my skills in designing user-friendly WordPress websites and developing innovative solutions as a Full Stack Developer. My diverse project portfolio includes the creation of an AI model for a virtual assistant and an Android-based chat application using Firebase. Beyond the realm of technology, I find joy in playing cricket, a sport that not only fuels my competitive spirit but also emphasizes teamworkâ€”a quality I seamlessly integrate into my professional pursuits. With a passion for staying at the forefront of technological advancements and a commitment to delivering exceptional results, I am excited about the endless possibilities in the dynamic field of software development.
